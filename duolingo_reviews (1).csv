The best app to learn other languages <3,5,2025-04-25 20:23:56
"what the actual sigma, why do i have to spend gems to do lessons? and ads also appeared, this is getting bad. i didn't buy anything but had infinite hearts, but they disappeared :( (i didn't lose my streak). I like the different ways to learn a language you add like games, stories or radio. I haven't tried learning music and math is too easy. I want more, like programming or other school subjects!",4,2025-04-25 20:22:46
"Got a 3 minute unskippable add for some dumb Kingdom game. I get you need ads to keep it free, but don't keep me sat there for 3 minutes whilst I was someone play ""the hardest level"". Seems like a forced way to make people pay to remove ads!",1,2025-04-25 20:20:44

احلا برنامج اتعلمت بسرعه يستاهل خمس نجوم ولله,5,2025-04-25 20:16:32
this app is so buggy. i got to the end of unit 4 in Chinese but can't complete the unit because the end of unit test is broken. the UI elements can't be clicked. so that's it. the course can't be continued. loaded it multiple times. always the same.,1,2025-04-25 20:15:36
it's really good Im still doing lesson but it helps with a lot and I'm making progress with Spanish and I would recommend 50 days so that way you would know more word than 1 or 2 words.,5,2025-04-25 20:14:45
it has improved my French and helped me learn new words,5,2025-04-25 20:11:50
"just started learning Japanese, and I can already tell that it is a well put together program.",5,2025-04-25 20:11:45
"It's been a while I use duo, the wise and fun owl, learning English. A couple of days ago, I saw a lot of differences made upon my course ( Chinese). A lot of lessons are added, as completed units, despite the fact that I have never done them before. This has really let me down... I really did lose my passion, I see a lot of things covered, which actually are not....",4,2025-04-25 20:10:22
I would do 5 stars but I made an account kept on sending me to level one so I'm deleting it and re-downloading it I'm not going to make account and see if this works,4,2025-04-25 20:08:22
😍😍😍,5,2025-04-25 20:08:02
eh good enough,5,2025-04-25 20:06:58

"Very good, it is a nice app.",5,2025-04-25 20:04:53
Meaningful to me,5,2025-04-25 20:04:00
it has really helped me learn German in so many ways! I can now order what I want in a KAFFE shop! haha! there are so many languages to learn. they have many different techniques to help teach you a language! If your looking for the right app this is the one!,5,2025-04-25 20:03:23
I'm revising my stars from 5 to 2 because of the last update. I'm taking Chinese and it has placed me ahead of where I should be and had me practicing words and symbols that I haven't learned yet. I've had to go back 2 units so far. The way this is going I may need to start over. This is the first time an update has put me this far behind. Learning this language was hard enough without this. Thinking of using a different app. Very unhappy.,2,2025-04-25 19:57:43
amazing had a competition at school and won 1st,5,2025-04-25 19:56:52

"Love Duolingo and it’s fun and definitely way cheaper than any other language course but I’d be great if they could add thai to learn. Otherwise great interface, works seamlessly and keeps learning new words and sentences fun. Sometimes not sure about actual daily use tho ahaha",5,2025-04-25 19:52:47
"Very nice I'm actually learning German! edit: why duolingo has ""very safe toys?""",5,2025-04-25 19:50:56

amazing,5,2025-04-25 19:38:29
"I really like this app, but some bug has completely messed up my progress. Nothing makes any sense. Previous chapters include completely different words. And it's showing me I completed chapters that I almost learned nothing about. I have no clue where to start now. I'm redoing previous chapters, learning like they are new chapters, but it feels very frustrating. Practicing on my computer is tedious as hell, since I just can't solve many of the things I'm asked. Please fix this",1,2025-04-25 19:35:27
it takes so long to load 😫😡,1,2025-04-25 19:33:52

super glitchy. I have to clear my cache & reset my phone everyday or the app gets stuck in a loop & the same levels keep repeating despite a perfect score.,3,2025-04-25 19:24:40
I love it and think it is good for learning different languages! Wish there wasn't any lives so I could play more☹️,4,2025-04-25 19:22:13

"full of bugs, examples are many times ridiculous (cannot imagine any situation i can use them like that), voice recognition is just a pain... not working 3 times in a row, u can play sound example for speech task, hints are buggy (optional/other words offered not accepted), other correct order of words not accepted... these'll lose u hearts, making u frustrated. ads will melt ur ears due to improper sound normalization. this application is famous but veeery far from worth the subscription fee...",1,2025-04-25 19:07:05
fun things like the store doesn't open often it just keeps running make me give this a low score along with the annoyance of the upgrade upgrade upgrade upgrade upgrade but most of all be Hungarian for it sucks there are things that are just straight up wrong I live with someone who's a native Hungarian speaker who's like that don't listen to that it's terrible,2,2025-04-25 19:06:58

I've used a few different apps to aid in learning Japanese and Duolingo makes it fun! The lessons are great and the achievements/streaks make it extra fun to hit those milestones!,5,2025-04-25 19:00:39
"I love this app now when I go to France or Paris. I know that I don't need to worry about speaking to people, I can just easily talk French, Spanish like it's so easy everybody should have this app like if you need it.
